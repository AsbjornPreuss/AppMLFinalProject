# AppMLFinalProject  
</center>
This repository contains the work done for the final project in Applied Machine Learning 2024, done by Asbj√∏rn, Daniel, Sejr and Jens.

The project used supervised learning to recognize different particles in a DARMIC data set. It furthermore used unsupervised learning to recognize and cluster different particles, with the hope that the machine learning algorithm could find and separate new particles, that we humans could not.
